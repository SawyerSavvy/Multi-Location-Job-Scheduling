    "$$\\Large \\text{Introduction}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a near-future world where the line between organic warfare and artificial intelligence has all but disappeared, autonomous nations and militarized AIs are locked in a technological arms race. The battleground? Combat-optimized robotic gorillas highly engineered biomechanical units designed for both brute force and tactical adaptability. Gerald's company operates as a neutral manufacturer and supplier in this escalating human-versus-robot conflict, producing elite gorilla units for both sides. Gerald does not take sides; he delivers to the highest bidder. His business is called Northrop Gorilla. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each faction, whether a human-led coalition or an AGI-led autonomous military, submits multiple gorilla production requests per quarter. Each unit consists of multiple development stages, from chassis fabrication, structural welding, system integration. Every request includes a deadline, a revenue offer, a priority level tied to strategic importance, and detailed requirements for machines and worker teams. Every stage requires specific machines (e.g., Painter, Inspector), skilled workers, and materials such as Steel, Plastic, and Paint, all of which are tracked and constrained in our facility's inventory. Each client submits an order with a deadline, offered revenue, and a priority score reflecting its tactical urgency or political weight. Gerald also changes these priority skills based his relationship with the general submitting the request. For context, Gerald and General Perplexity are the best of mates. The opposite can be said of Gerald and General Grok.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Northrop Gorilla must submit its earnings report in 25 days. What projects can Northrop Gorilla finish within that timeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We manage this process using two primary datasets:\n",
    "`Projects_Data_with_Stage_Durations.csv`: Defines each 22 gorilla unit (project) requests, including stage-by-stage resource requirements (machines, workers, materials), duration in days, customer priority score, and total offered revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Locations_Capabilities.csv`: Describes the available resources at our factory — the inventory of Steel, Plastic, and Paint, the list of skilled workers with associated capabilities, and the available machines, each with defined functionalities and breakdown probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To schedule gorilla production efficiently, we implement a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) using Julia and the JuMP framework. The model makes the following decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which gorilla orders to accept\n",
    "2. When to begin each stage of each accepted order\n",
    "3. Which machines and workers to assign to each stage\n",
    "4. Whether a unit can be completed by its deadline without violating resource constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling Assumptions\n",
    "To keep the problem solvable under tight manufacturing timelines, we adopt the following simplifications:\n",
    "Fixed stage durations: Each stage takes a known number of days with no variability or delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`No simulated breakdowns`: Although machines have associated breakdown probabilities, we assume full reliability during scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Material usage is predefined`: Resource consumption per stage (Steel, Plastic, Paint) is fixed and known.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Deadlines are strict`: Units not completed by the specified date yield no revenue."
